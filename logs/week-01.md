## Technical Activities
- Created and configured a GitHub repository for the full-stack web application project
- Defined the high-level system architecture for a React-based frontend and Node.js backend
- Selected and locked an industry-standard technology stack:
  - Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
  - Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
  - Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Set up core project documentation including README, MIT license, and standard Node/React `.gitignore`
- Designed an initial folder structure for frontend and backend services
- Established development best practices including version control, commit conventions, and Kanban-based Agile workflow

## Project Planning & Requirements Preparation
- Began preliminary requirements analysis for an order submission and data processing system
- Identified potential core user flows such as order creation, data validation, and backend storage
- Prepared discussion points and technical questions for an upcoming client requirements meeting
- Planned an Agile development approach to convert client requirements into user stories and implementation tasks
