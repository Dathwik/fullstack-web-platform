# Full-Stack Web Platform

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a full-stack web application developed as part of my Post-Completion OPT self-employment as a Software Engineer. The application is designed using a modern full-stack approach, integrating frontend and backend components, database logic, and network APIs.

## Technologies (planned)
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Vercel / Heroku / AWS (as applicable)

## Core Functionality
- User interactions through a React interface
- Backend REST API for data processing and storage
- Database schema design and relationship handling
- Authentication and validation logic

## Relation to Field of Study
The project requires the application of software engineering principles and computer science fundamentals such as data structures, algorithms, system design, API architecture, and database management — all core to my Computer Science degree.

## Development Status
Actively under development as part of full-time (20+ hrs/week) OPT self-employment.
