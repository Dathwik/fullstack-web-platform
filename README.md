# Full-Stack Web Platform

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a full-stack web application developed as part of my Post-Completion OPT self-employment.  
The application is designed using modern full-stack technologies to handle user interactions, backend processing, and data persistence.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical application of core Computer Science concepts including web development, API design, database management, and system architecture.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- Deployment (optional): Vercel / Heroku / AWS

## Features
- User interface for submitting and managing data
- RESTful APIs for client-server communication
- Authentication and authorization workflows
- Data validation and error handling

## Relation to Field of Study
This project applies software engineering principles and practical programming skills that directly relate to my Computer Science major. Core activities include architecture design, backend development, database design, API creation, and integration testing.

## Status
Actively under development as part of full-time OPT self-employment (20+ hours/week).
